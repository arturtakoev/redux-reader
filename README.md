Simple reader app which fetches news from several resources and combines them to one feed. 

You can either select an option to fetch all news at once or choose only those sources that you are interested in.

The app is deployed at Github Pages here: https://arturtakoev.github.io/redux-reader/

All the source code can be checked in the master branch of this repo.
